# Sudoku Solver by Walter Woshid

This is my second sudoku solver. The first one I developed in a race with my girlfriend in one night. I finished it first, but hers was faster :)

This is a simple [backtracing algorithm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking) trying to insert every number and testing if it's valid.
